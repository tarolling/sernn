Self-expanding RNNs

## Usage

Please install Python 3.11.0.

To set up a virtual environment, use `python3 -m venv .venv`. You can run `source .venv/bin/activate` from the current working directory to activate the virtual environment. If you want to exit the venv, run `deactivate`.

You should probably run `pip install --upgrade pip` since pip is always out of date in venvs. To install all required dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` with the virtual environment activated.
