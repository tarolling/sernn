Self-Expanding RNNs

## Usage

Please install Python 3.12. (my specific version was 3.12.5)

To set up a virtual environment, use `python3 -m venv .venv`. You can run `source .venv/bin/activate` from the current working directory to activate the virtual environment. If you want to exit the venv, run `deactivate`.

To install all required dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` with the virtual environment activated.
